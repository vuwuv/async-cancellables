## Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS (version 18 or later) and NPM.

## Installation

To install and set up the library, run:

```sh
$ npm install async-cancellables
```

## API

Exports basic classes (any of them can be used via standalone packages)

- CancellationToken from [@async-cancellables/ct](https://npmjs.com/package/@async-cancellables/ct)
- AsyncLock from [@async-cancellables/async-lock](https://npmjs.com/package/@async-cancellables/async-lock)
- AsyncState from [@async-cancellables/async-state](https://npmjs.com/package/@async-cancellables/async-state)

The rest of the classes should be installed separately

- AsyncCooldownQueue from [@async-cancellables/async-cooldown-queue](https://npmjs.com/package/@async-cancellables/async-cooldown-queue)
- AsyncHybridLimit from [@async-cancellables/async-hybrid-limit](https://npmjs.com/package/@async-cancellables/async-hybrid-limit)

## Examples

### Simple await with timeout

```js
CT.timeout(5000).waitPromise(asyncCall());
```

Waits for `asyncCall()` to finish, but throws an error it if it takes more than 5 seconds. The call itself is not cancelled, it will continue to run in the background.

### File download function limiting concurrent downloads

```js
const asyncLock = new AsyncLock(5);

async function downloadFile(url, ct = null) {
    const ticket = await asyncLock.waitOne(ct);
    try {
        return await ct.waitPromise(got(url));
    }
    finally {
        ticket.release();
    }
}

const content = await downloadFile('https://example.com/', CT.timeout(5000));
```

Downloads file from `url` with 5 concurrent downloads. If it takes more than 5 seconds, and the function still waits for a slot, it will exit the queue and throw an error. If it is already downloading, the function will throw an error immediately, but actual download will continue in the background. `asyncLock.waitOne` call supports cancellation, so if `ct` is cancelled, the function will exit the queue.

### Cancellable async calls via socket

```js
socket.on('connection', (client) => {
    const clientCT = CT.event(client, 'disconnect');

    client.on('startProcessing', (...args) => {
        const key = randomKey();
        const requestCT = CT.event(client, `cancelProcessing_${key}`).attachTo(clientCT);
        processing(requestCT, ...args).then(result => client.emit(`finishProcessing_${key}`, result), error => !CT.isCancellationError(error) && console.log(error));
    });
});
```

Socket processes async calls of `processing()` function. If client disconnects, all pending calls are cancelled. If client sends `cancelProcessing_${key}` event, the call with the same key is cancelled. `clientCT` is getting cancelled when client disconnects, it is created once per connection. `requestCT` is getting cancelled when client disconnects or sends `cancelProcessing_${key}` event, it is created once per call and attached to `clientCT` to cancel all calls when client disconnects.

### Cancellable sleep promise

```js
async function sleep(ms, ct = null) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let timeout;
        if (ct) {
          ct.throwIfCancelled();
          [resolve, reject] = ct.processCancel(resolve, reject, clearTimeout.bind(null, timeout));
        }
        timeout = setTimeout(resolve, ms);
    });
}
```

Example of binding cancellation token to a promise. If `ct` is cancelled, the promise will be rejected with `ct` error. If `ct` is not cancelled, the promise will be resolved after `ms` milliseconds. `ct.throwIfCancelled()` checks if `ct` is already cancelled and throws an error if it is. `ct.processCancel()` returns a new `resolve` and `reject` functions that will prevent calling cancel function (in this case it is `clearTimeout.bind(null, timeout)`) after promise is resolved or rejected. On cancelling `ct`, `onCancel` function will be called, it should stop the operation that is being waited for. In this case, it is clearing existing timeout.
